OLED_SSD1332
============
This it's a Hyper Fast library for drive solomon tech SSD1332 OLED displays. It's compatible with Arduino, Arduino DUE and Teensy 3.x and uses native SPI.
The features are:
 - Hyper Fast speed. On Teensy 3.x it uses SPI DMA at 24Mhz.
 - Compatible with Adafruit protocol, it uses Adafruit GFX library and it's fully supported.
 - Works with serial SPI protocol so only 5 or 4 pin are needed (2 of them still shareable).
 - Massive use of hardware accellerated commands for SSD chip.


Version History:
 - 0.5b1: First working release with full tested 24Mhz/DMA SPI on Teensy 3.
 -
